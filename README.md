# psets-drake-underactuated-robotics-6.832x

Some homeworks of course Underactuated Robotics 6.832x from edX solved here with code, mainly the ones that involve drake-distro library for MATLAB

So I'm using for this the precompiled versions of drake found at https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases. This is because I started solving the problems in 2015 - 2016, preparing myself for the next enrolling, that unfortunately never came. So now, I've dusted off the old files and complete the homeworks I was missing in the same precompiled version of drake. Although the solutions are currently on edX, i've done some modificacions, solving the problems in my way.
